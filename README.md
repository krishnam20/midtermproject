# midtermproject
Part 2 (Website component of the midterm project for Informatics 133)


HTML
----
Utilized 4 html files to create links between different parts of the portfolio webpage. All html files utilize the same stylesheet.


CSS
---
Utilized 1 external style sheet called main.css for all the styling of the webpage. No frameworks or libraries were utilized for the styling.


Media Queries
-------------
Utilized this media query to generate perfect CSS background image. I found helpful information about this from the link below.

Also created two media queries that make the navigational bar responsive and layer vertically when the broswer is compressed.
Found out how to do this via the link down below.

Javascript/Jquery
-----------------


Utilized jquery to have a goToTop button appear at the bottom of the page when scrolling.

Applied fadeIn and fadeOut feature which creates an animation of the goToTop icon appearing and exiting slowly.


Images
------
Folder Containing all the images used for the project. Background images were taken from unsplash.com.



Additionl Informatics
----------------------
This information is also described in the comments of the code.
Website layout and aesthetic needs to be improved in the long run. Will do this for the final project if that is part of the requirements.
