				<div class="mainAboutMeDiv">
					<p>I am an undergraduate student at University of California Irvine pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Informatics. I have a passion for technology, developing applications to enrich peoplesâ€™ lives, and improving business to shape our society. I am interested in software engineering and its integration within the areas of user experience and user design (UI/UX), information systems, and social networking applications. I am currently searching for a full-time opportunity in a software development position in on of the areas I listed above.</p>

					<p> Outside of engineering I enjoy a variety of sports related activties with hiking in scenic environments and weighlifting being two of my favorites in that department. You can find me listening + jamming out to a variety of styles of music. Recently, I got into rock music and has led to me picking up an interest playing the electric guitar. In my downtime away from lifting, hiking, and music I have become interested in anime as a medium of entertainment due to the gorgeous animation style, use of soundtracks, and character driven stories. In the future I might even create a website discussing various topics in anime community.
